a minecraft -wannabe-like sandbox game in the terminal, with infinite "terrain" generation


Using ncurses and a bit of Xlib for the input because ncurses inputs are terrible for games  
This is very much a work in progress  
For now it only features block breaking



## TODO

- Block placing
- Better keymap
- The terrain is a sin()*sin(), i am planning to use perlin noise
- Better controls
- Game design
